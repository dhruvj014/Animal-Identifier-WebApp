## Features

This project was made using a number of different coding languages:

    1) We first prepared the image training model based off an image dataset using Jupyter Notebook
    2) We then exported the models as pickle files.
    3) Next, we began implementing the model in flask.
    4) Here, we used CSS,HTML and Django HTML to beautify the webapp.
    5) Finally we deployed the app!


## End

This is my first project with active use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hope you liked it.
